Programming Assignment 5
A FUSE Encrypted File System

By Logan McCaul

Various files adopted from other exiting work.
See file comments for specific details and references.

---Dependencies---
fuse-utils
openssl
attr
attr-dev
libfuse-dev
libssl1.0.0 or libssl0.9.8
libssl-dev

Note: To use extended attributes (xattr) on EXT filesystems,
      you must add the 'user_xattr' mount option to the
      mount options of any mounts on which you intend to use 
      extended attributes. Failure to so may result in an error
      when trying to set, get, or remove xattr values.
