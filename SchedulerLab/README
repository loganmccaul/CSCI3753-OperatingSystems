By Logan McCaul - 2014

---Folders---
data - All the data from the benchmarks will go here

---Executables---
./runTests - A simple bash script for running the benchmarks (Run as root or sudo)
./pi - A simple program for statistically calculating pi.
./rw - A simple i/o bound program.
./mixed - A simple program that calculates pi then writes it to the disk.
./run - A program that changes the scheduling policy then forks one of the possible benchmark processes.


---Examples---
Build:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

pi:
 ./pi
 ./pi <Number of Iterations>

mixed:
 ./pi-sched
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations>
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations> <#Bytes to Write to Output File> 
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations> <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size>
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations> <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Output Filename>

rw:
 ./rw
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File>
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size>
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Input Filename>
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Input Filename> <Output Filename>

runTests:
 sudo ./runTests

run:
 ./run
